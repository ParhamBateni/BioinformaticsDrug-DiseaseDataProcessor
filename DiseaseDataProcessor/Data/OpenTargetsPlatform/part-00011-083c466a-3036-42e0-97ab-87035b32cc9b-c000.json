Another kind of aspergillosis is invasive aspergillosis. This infection usually affects people with weakened immune systems due to cancer, AIDS, leukemia, organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or other conditions or events that reduce the number of normal white blood cells. In this condition, the fungus invades and damages tissues in the body. Invasive aspergillosis most commonly affects the lungs, but can also cause infection in many other organs and can spread throughout the body (commonly affecting the kidneys and brain). Aspergilloma, a growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of previous lung disease such as tuberculosis or lung abscess, is a third kind of aspergillosis. This type of aspergillosis is composed of a tangled mass of fungus fibers, blood clots, and white blood cells. The fungus ball gradually enlarges, destroying lung tissue in the process, but usually does not spread to other areas.","name":"aspergillosis","parents":["MONDO_0002312"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["Aspergillosis","infection due to Aspergillus","aspergillosis","Infection due to Aspergillus"]},"ancestors":["MONDO_0100336","MONDO_0002312","EFO_0005741","MONDO_0002041"],"descendants":["EFO_1001834","EFO_0007393","EFO_0007140"],"children":["EFO_0007140","EFO_0007393","EFO_1001834"],"therapeuticAreas":["MONDO_0100336","EFO_0005741"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":false,"sources":{"url":"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0007157","name":"EFO_0007157"}}}

The term refers to two different syndromes, each representing a different stage of the disease. Wernicke's encephalopathy represents the 'acute' phase and Korsakoff's syndrome represents the 'chronic' phase. However, they are used interchangeable in many sites. Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterized by confusion, abnormal stance and gait (ataxia), and abnormal eye movements (nystagmus). Korsakoff's syndrome is observed in a small number of patients. It is a type of dementia, characterized by memory loss and confabulation (filling in of memory gaps with data the patient can readily recall) and involvement of the heart, vascular, and nervous system. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome mainly results from chronic alcohol use, but also from dietary deficiencies, prolonged vomiting, eating disorders, systemic diseases (cancer, AIDS, infections), bariatric surgery, transplants, or the effects of chemotherapy. Studies indicate that there may be some genetic predisposition for the disease.Treatment involves supplementing the diet with thiamine. Wernicke encephalopathy is an acute syndrome and requires emergency treatment to prevent death and neurologic complications. In cases where the diagnosis is not confirmed, patients should still be treated while additional evaluations are completed.","name":"Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome","parents":["EFO_1001067"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["Korsakoff Syndrome","Korsakoff syndrome","Korsakoff's syndrome","Korsakoff's psychosis","Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome","Wernicke encephalopathy","Korsakov's psychosis","Korsakoff's psychosis (disorder)","Korsakov psychosis"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["alcohol-induced encephalopathy","transketolase defect"]},"ancestors":["EFO_0000589","EFO_0001069","OTAR_0000020","EFO_1001067"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000020"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_1001242","name":"EFO_1001242"}}}

At exam, visual acuity is reduced and the optic disc is swollen. In both subtypes, visual field examination is often reduced in the inferior and central visual fields.

The signs and symptoms include frequent nosebleeds; abnormally heavy or prolonged menstruation ; easy bruising; recurrent anemia ; and abnormal bleeding after surgery, dental work or childbirth. Platelet storage pool deficiencies may be genetic or acquired (non-genetic).

Other causes include low blood magnesium levels, a side effect of radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism, metabolic alkalosis, DiGeorge syndrome, and type I polyglandular autoimmune syndrome.
