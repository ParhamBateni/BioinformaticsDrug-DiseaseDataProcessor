Symptoms typically begin in infancy and may include development of cataracts (clouding of the eye lens); blindness; hair loss (alopecia); abnormal changes to the perineum (the area between the anus and external genitalia); and small, skin-colored bumps (keratosis pilaris). Terminal lung disease has also been reported. The cause of HMD is thought to be an abnormality in desmosomes and gap junctions, which are structures involved in cell-to-cell contact. HMD typically follows autosomal dominant inheritance, but has occurred sporadically (in an individual who has no family history of the condition). Treatment typically focuses on individual symptoms of the condition.","name":"Hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia","parents":["Orphanet_183494"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["Urban-Schosser-Spohn syndrome","hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["Hmd","mucoepithelial dysplasia, hereditary"]},"ancestors":["OTAR_0000018","EFO_0000701","Orphanet_68346","EFO_0000540","EFO_0000508","Orphanet_183494","EFO_0010285","MONDO_0024255"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000018","EFO_0000540","EFO_0010285"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_1839","name":"Orphanet_1839"}}}

Gastrointestinal issues can cause failure to thrive, painful constipation, and diarrhea. The constipation is due to intestinal dysmotility, where the the muscles and nerves of the digestive system do not move food through the digestive tract like it should. Signs and symptoms of HSAN7 usually appear at birth or during infancy. The inability to feel pain often leads to repeated, severe injuries, including bone fractures and joint dislocations. People with HSAN7 may also heal slowly putting them at risk for further complications, such as infection. Excessive sweating may cause itching. Other features may include partial insensitivity to cold and hot temperatures, mild muscle weakness, and motor skill delays. HSAN7 is not known to affect learning or intelligence. Treatment of HSAN7 aims to prevent injury and treat gastrointestinal and orthopedic problems. HSAN7 is caused by a mutation in the SCN11A gene. People with HSAN7 have a 1 in 2 or 50% chance of passing the condition on to each of their children.

HPAH has been linked to mutations in BMPR2 in 75% of cases; other genes implicated in HPAH include ACVR1, BMPR1, CAV1, ENG and SMAD9 and CBLN2. (However, the majority of patients carrying an HPAH mutation do not develop PAH). Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IFPAH) refers to those cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension in which etiology remains unknown.","name":"Idiopathic and/or familial pulmonary arterial hypertension","parents":["Orphanet_156629","MONDO_0001999","EFO_0001361","Orphanet_156610"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["pulmonary hypertension, primary, type 1","idiopathic and/or familial pulmonary arterial hypertension","IFPAH"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["pulmonary hypertension, primary, 1","PPH1"]},"ancestors":["MONDO_0000473","Orphanet_98056","OTAR_0000018","MONDO_0000651","MONDO_0005149","OTAR_0000010","EFO_0001361","EFO_0003144","EFO_0009690","EFO_0000373","Orphanet_156610","EFO_0004264","MONDO_0001493","EFO_0003086","MONDO_0004596","EFO_0000684","EFO_0003777","Orphanet_156629","MONDO_0001999","EFO_0000508","EFO_0000537","EFO_0000319"],"descendants":["Orphanet_31837","Orphanet_275777","Orphanet_199241","Orphanet_275766"],"children":["Orphanet_275777"],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000018","OTAR_0000010","EFO_0009690","EFO_0000319"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":false,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_422","name":"Orphanet_422"}}}
