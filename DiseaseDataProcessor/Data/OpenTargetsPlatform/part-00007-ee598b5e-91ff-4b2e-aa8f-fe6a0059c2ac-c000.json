Because of the variation in clinical presentation and a lack of a specific diagnostic finding on histopathology, a uniformly accepted definition of parapsoriasis remains lacking.

The term refers to two different syndromes, each representing a different stage of the disease. Wernicke's encephalopathy represents the 'acute' phase and Korsakoff's syndrome represents the 'chronic' phase. However, they are used interchangeable in many sites. Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterized by confusion, abnormal stance and gait (ataxia), and abnormal eye movements (nystagmus). Korsakoff's syndrome is observed in a small number of patients. It is a type of dementia, characterized by memory loss and confabulation (filling in of memory gaps with data the patient can readily recall) and involvement of the heart, vascular, and nervous system. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome mainly results from chronic alcohol use, but also from dietary deficiencies, prolonged vomiting, eating disorders, systemic diseases (cancer, AIDS, infections), bariatric surgery, transplants, or the effects of chemotherapy. Studies indicate that there may be some genetic predisposition for the disease.Treatment involves supplementing the diet with thiamine. Wernicke encephalopathy is an acute syndrome and requires emergency treatment to prevent death and neurologic complications. In cases where the diagnosis is not confirmed, patients should still be treated while additional evaluations are completed.","name":"Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome","parents":["EFO_1001067"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["Korsakoff Syndrome","Korsakoff syndrome","Korsakoff's syndrome","Korsakoff's psychosis","Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome","Wernicke encephalopathy","Korsakov's psychosis","Korsakoff's psychosis (disorder)","Korsakov psychosis"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["alcohol-induced encephalopathy","transketolase defect"]},"ancestors":["EFO_0000589","EFO_0001069","OTAR_0000020","EFO_1001067"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000020"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_1001242","name":"EFO_1001242"}}}

Brain imaging at 4 months of age showed diffuse cerebral atrophy with thinning of the corpus callosum, and ophthalmologic examination showed myopic astigmatism.

The proband was a 3-year-old boy with global developmental delay, progressive microcephaly (-9 SD), no head control, no speech, and generalized hypotonia with contractures of the ankles and fingers. He developed refractory seizures at 2 months of age. He also had swallowing difficulties and was tube-fed. Both patients had dysmorphic facial features, including low-set ears, long eyelashes, sloping forehead, micrognathia, and short nose with flat nasal bridge. Brain imaging showed progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, decreased white matter, subcortical white matter hyperintensities, and thinning of corpus callosum.

Other causes include low blood magnesium levels, a side effect of radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism, metabolic alkalosis, DiGeorge syndrome, and type I polyglandular autoimmune syndrome.
