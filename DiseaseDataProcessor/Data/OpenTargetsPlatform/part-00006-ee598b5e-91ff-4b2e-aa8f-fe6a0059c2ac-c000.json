CDG is comprised of phenotypically diverse disorders affecting multiple systems including the central nervous system, muscle function, immunity, endocrine system, and coagulation. The numerous entities in this group are subdivided, based on the synthetic pathway affected, into disorder of protein N-glycosylation, disorder of protein O-glycosylation, disorder of multiple glycosylation, and disorder of glycosphingolipid and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor glycosylation.","name":"Congenital disorder of glycosylation","parents":["Orphanet_68367","MONDO_0024322"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["carbohydrate deficient glycoprotein syndrome","CDG","congenital disorder of glycosylation","carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome","Carbohydrate deficient glycoprotein syndrome"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndromes","congenital disorders of glycosylation"]},"ancestors":["EFO_0000589","OTAR_0000018","Orphanet_68367","OTAR_0000020","EFO_0000508","MONDO_0024322"],"descendants":["Orphanet_324422","Orphanet_263463","MONDO_0060627","Orphanet_263501","Orphanet_209024","Orphanet_363623","MONDO_0040500","Orphanet_207113","Orphanet_272","Orphanet_206549","Orphanet_370968","Orphanet_207119","Orphanet_263508","Orphanet_163985","Orphanet_709","MONDO_0007585","Orphanet_309778","Orphanet_306661","Orphanet_280071","MONDO_0007586","Orphanet_280633","MONDO_0010075","Orphanet_357058","MONDO_0100455","Orphanet_2834","MONDO_0011688","Orphanet_2953","Orphanet_263516","MONDO_0014790","MONDO_0033374","Orphanet_2311","Orphanet_83639","MONDO_0700070","Orphanet_352479","MONDO_0700071","Orphanet_371195","Orphanet_371235","Orphanet_263487","MONDO_0700075","Orphanet_329178","Orphanet_309526","Orphanet_369837","Orphanet_371071","Orphanet_206564","MONDO_0014789","MONDO_0700067","MONDO_0700068","MONDO_0700066","MONDO_0030037","Orphanet_370943","MONDO_0700069","Orphanet_353327","MONDO_0100062","Orphanet_263494","EFO_0009149","Orphanet_79145","MONDO_0700084","Orphanet_324737","Orphanet_91131","Orphanet_309515","Orphanet_209033","EFO_0009384","EFO_0009383","Orphanet_209030","Orphanet_602","Orphanet_447","Orphanet_357074","Orphanet_314667","Orphanet_206554","Orphanet_370959","Orphanet_321","Orphanet_209027","Orphanet_207122","MONDO_0030043","Orphanet_3144","Orphanet_206559","Orphanet_371176","Orphanet_371054","Orphanet_294049","Orphanet_371212","Orphanet_300536","Orphanet_99843","Orphanet_369894","Orphanet_98873","Orphanet_309505","MONDO_0032918","Orphanet_300496","Orphanet_309347","Orphanet_309469","Orphanet_370927","EFO_0020000","Orphanet_228418","MONDO_0030054","Orphanet_370924","MONDO_0030059","Orphanet_79318","Orphanet_370921","Orphanet_79319","Orphanet_79327","Orphanet_79328","Orphanet_79325","Orphanet_371064","Orphanet_79326","Orphanet_79323","Orphanet_79324","Orphanet_79321","Orphanet_371188","Orphanet_79322","Orphanet_238459","Orphanet_86812","Orphanet_79320","MONDO_0014916","Orphanet_363417","Orphanet_371183","Orphanet_309458","Orphanet_370938","Orphanet_309463","Orphanet_588","Orphanet_171714","Orphanet_370930","Orphanet_356961","MONDO_0013389","Orphanet_79329","MONDO_0014353","Orphanet_370933","Orphanet_353217","MONDO_0054845","Orphanet_371157","Orphanet_79332","Orphanet_75496","Orphanet_79333","Orphanet_397941","Orphanet_370980","Orphanet_79330","MONDO_0060724","Orphanet_93360","Orphanet_86309","Orphanet_899","Orphanet_309568","Orphanet_309447","MONDO_0060720","MONDO_0030072","MONDO_0014746","Orphanet_309450","EFO_0005545","EFO_0005546","MONDO_0013810","Orphanet_3474","Orphanet_95428","MONDO_0032895","Orphanet_319646","MONDO_0054559","MONDO_0011629","Orphanet_34515","Orphanet_244310","Orphanet_371047","Orphanet_371200","MONDO_0009667","MONDO_0000171","MONDO_0029135","Orphanet_247262","Orphanet_93359","MONDO_0014731","Orphanet_284139","Orphanet_280333","MONDO_0029140"],"children":["MONDO_0029140","MONDO_0030037","MONDO_0040500","MONDO_0060627","MONDO_0060720","MONDO_0060724","MONDO_0100062","EFO_0005545","EFO_0005546","Orphanet_309347","Orphanet_309447","Orphanet_309515","Orphanet_309526","Orphanet_371047","Orphanet_371157","Orphanet_371176","Orphanet_371188","Orphanet_371200","Orphanet_371235"],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000018","OTAR_0000020"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":false,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_137","name":"Orphanet_137"}}}

Signs and symptoms generally develop in late childhood or early adolescence and include pain, tenderness, and swelling in joints and at the enthesis. The knee and the back of the ankle (at the Achilles tendon) are the most commonly affected parts of the body. The underlying cause of enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis is currently unknown (idiopathic). It is very rare for more than one member of a family to have juvenile arthritis; however, research suggests that having a family member with juvenile arthritis or any autoimmune disease may increase the risk of having juvenile arthritis, in general.

This disorder may be caused by inadequate activation of progenitor B cells, defective class-switching or may even represent a maturational variant. Typically, a normal response to protein antigens is found while there is a notably diminished response to viral and bacterial polysaccharide antigens. Clinical presentation may include recurrent infections especially those of the respiratory tract.

The cysts keep urine from flowing freely through the tubules. MSK is present at birth but symptoms typically do not occur until adolescence or adulthood. Problems caused by MSK include blood in the urine, kidney stones, and urinary tract infections. MSK rarely leads to more serious problems, such as total kidney failure.

Signs and symptoms in children may include delayed motor and walking milestones, jerky muscle movements (myoclonus), upper limb dystonia, motor tics, and vocal tics. The chorea often improves with time. In some cases, myoclonus persists or worsens. Children with BHC can havenormal intellect, but may have learning and behavior problems. Other signs and symptoms include thyroid problems (e.g., hypothyroidism) and lung disease (e.g., recurring infections). Treatment is tailored to each child. Tetrabenazine and levodopa have been tried in individual cases with some success. BHC is caused by mutations in the NKX2-1 gene (also known as the TITF1 gene).
