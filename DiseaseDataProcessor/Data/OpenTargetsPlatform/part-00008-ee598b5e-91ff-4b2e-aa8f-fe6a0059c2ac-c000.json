The few patients described in the medical literature were characterized by brain anomalies; an unusual face with broad nasal root, wide spaced eyes (hypertelorism) and a very small chin (micrognathia); failure to thrive; severe intellectual disability ;and lack of muscle tone (hypotonia). Exams of the brain showed a poor development (hypoplasia) of the pale part of the brain known as white matter, and an absent or abnormal corpus callosum (nerve fibers joining the two hemispheres of the brain). Only a few cases have being described. The cause is unknown but may be related to a disorder of axonal development. The described cases seem to be inherited in an autosomal recessive or X-linked way. Corpus callosum agenesis is one of the more frequent congenital malformations. It can be either asymptomatic or associated with intellectual disability, epilepsy, or psychiatric syndromes. It can be part of several genetic syndromes, such as Aicardi syndrome, Andermann syndrome and Apert syndrome, trisomies 13, 18 ; or result from metabolic causes; drugs (cocaine); or viral infection (influenza).

Ce syndrome est très rare, il a été décrit dans moins de 20 familles comprenant plusieurs patients atteints à des générations successives. Les anomalies des extrémités intéressent le rayon radial et varient de l'hypoplasie de la phalange distale du pouce avec limitation de mobilité de l'articulation inter-phalangienne à l'hypoplasie sévère du pouce et à la polydactylie pré-axiale (duplication du pouce), parfois associée à une syndactylie des doigts. Les anomalies rénales vont de la malrotation à l'ectopie croisée avec fusion partielle sans vraie forme en fer à cheval ; on peut rencontrer d'autres anomalies de l'arbre urinaire telles que reflux vésico-urétéral et diverticules vésicaux. Les anomalies oculaires comprennent un colobome du nerf optique, un ptosis et/ou une anomalie de Duane (strabisme congénital caractérisé par une limitation du mouvement horizontal de l'oeil, une rétraction du globe et un rétrécissement de la fente palpébrale lors de l'adduction). Une surdité neuro-sensorielle a été décrite chez certains patients ; c'est pourquoi il a été proposé que le syndrome de Okihiro (anomalie de Duane associée à des anomalies du rayon radial et à une surdité) et le syndrome acro-oculo-renal pouvaient constituer une entité unique. Le syndrome acro-oculo-renal se transmet sur le mode autosomique dominant, et une mutation du gène SALL4 (gène identifié chez des patients avec une anomalie de Duane) a été retrouvée dans l'une des familles décrites. Le patient avait, outre l'anomalie de Duane et une atteinte du rayon des membres et des reins, une surdité neuro-sensorielle, ce qui évoque un syndrome de Okihiro.","name":"Acro-renal-ocular syndrome","parents":["Orphanet_330206"],"ancestors":["Orphanet_183533","Orphanet_330206","OTAR_0000018","MONDO_0019042","MONDO_0015161","EFO_0000508","MONDO_0019755","Orphanet_183530"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000018"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_959","name":"Orphanet_959"}}}

This is the most widespread form of polymicrogyria and typically affects the entire surface of the brain. Signs and symptoms include severe intellectual disability, problems with movement, and seizures that are difficult or impossible to treat. While the exact cause of bilateral generalized polymicrogyria is not fully understood, it is thought to be due to improper brain development during embryonic growth. Most cases appear to follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.

Signs and symptoms of CBG deficiency vary. While some individuals may experience no symptoms, others are found to have a fatty liver and chronic pain. Some people with CBG deficiency also have chronic fatigue syndrome. CGB deficiency is caused by mutations in the SERPINA6 gene. The SERPINA6 gene is commonly also referred to as the CBG gene. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported.While there is still no cure, treatment options will depend on the type and severity of symptoms present and may involve several specialists.","name":"Corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency","parents":["Orphanet_183637","EFO_0005539"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency","CBG deficiency","transcortin deficiency","Transcortin deficiency"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["corticosteroid-binding globulin, elevated","Cbg deficiency"]},"ancestors":["OTAR_0000018","EFO_0001379","Orphanet_183637","Orphanet_156638","EFO_0000508","EFO_0005539"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000018","EFO_0001379"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_199247","name":"Orphanet_199247"}}}

XLAG differs considerably from classical lissencephaly, as the resulting cortical thickness is only 6-7 mm in XLAG, rather than 15-20 mm seen in classical lissencephaly due to mutations of the PAFAH1B1 or DCX genes. In 2002, mutations in the X-linked aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX ; Xp21.3) were identified in individuals with XLAG and in some of their female relatives. Mouse Arx and human ARX are highly expressed in both dorsal and ventral telencephalon, including the neocortical ventricular zone and germinal zone of the ganglionic eminence, with less intense signals in the subventricular zone, cortical plate, hippocampus, basal ganglia and ventral thalamus. Arx-deficient mice showed deficient tangential migration and abnormal differentiation of GABAergic interneurons in the ganglionic eminence and neocortex, as well as abnormal testicular differentiation. These characteristics include some of the clinical features of XLAG in humans. The ARX mutations in XLAG patients were predominantly premature termination mutations (large deletions, frameshift, nonsense mutations, splice site mutations) while the missense mutations were less common and located essentially in the homeobox domain. Patients carrying nonconservative missense mutations within the homeobox, showed less severe XLAG, while conservative substitution in the homeodomain caused Proud syndrome (ACC with abnormal genitalia). A non conservative missense mutation near the C-terminal aristaless domain caused unusually severe XLAG with microcephaly and mild cerebellar hypoplasia. The ARX mutations are also associated with a spectrum of milder phenotypes, without macroscopic malformations of the brain, such as X-linked infantile spasms, a syndrome featuring mental retardation associated with distal dystonic movements (Partington syndrome), autistic features and nonsyndromicintellectual deficit.","name":"X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia","parents":["Orphanet_102010","MONDO_0018496","Orphanet_269573","Orphanet_98087"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["XLAG syndrome","lissencephaly, X-linked, type 2","X-linked lissencephaly-agenesis of the corpus callosum-genital anomalies syndrome","X-linked lissencephaly-corpus callosum agenesis-genital anomalies syndrome","XLAG (X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia) syndrome","X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia","X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia","X-linked lissencephaly - agenesis of the corpus callosum - genital anomalies"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["XLAG syndrome","lissencephaly, X-linked, 2","Xlisg","LISX2","X-linked lissencephaly - agenesis of the corpus callosum - genital anomalies","lissencephaly, X-linked 2","hydranencephaly and abnormal genitalia","lissencephaly, X-linked, with ambiguous genitalia","hydranencephaly with abnormal genitalia"]},"ancestors":["Orphanet_183763","Orphanet_183521","MONDO_0002025","Orphanet_48471","EFO_0004280","EFO_0005774","Orphanet_183506","MONDO_0000425","EFO_0009690","Orphanet_269564","Orphanet_156622","MONDO_0002320","EFO_0000512","Orphanet_71859","EFO_0000677","EFO_0000474","EFO_0000618","MONDO_0100284","EFO_0005548","Orphanet_102010","MONDO_0019755","MONDO_0000508","Orphanet_182079","EFO_0009663","OTAR_0000017","Orphanet_98464","Orphanet_98087","OTAR_0000018","Orphanet_183512","Orphanet_165707","MONDO_0002259","Orphanet_183757","Orphanet_269573","Orphanet_325706","MONDO_0020022","EFO_0009386","Orphanet_306765","MONDO_0020606","Orphanet_156619","Orphanet_166472","EFO_0001379","Orphanet_156638","Orphanet_325690","EFO_0000508","Orphanet_166478","MONDO_0016054","MONDO_0018496","Orphanet_183530"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["MONDO_0002025","EFO_0009690","EFO_0000618","OTAR_0000017","OTAR_0000018","EFO_0001379"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_452","name":"Orphanet_452"}}}

Individuals with LCH have a typical male genetic make-up (46, XY), but due to lowered levels of androgens, may have a range of genital (reproductive organ) differences. Individuals with LCH may have a small penis (micropenis),the opening of the urethra may be located on the underside of the penis (hypospadias), or the scrotum may be divided into two halves (bifid scrotum). Given these differences in development, the external genitalia may not appear clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia). Some individuals with LCH can have female external genitalia and small testes that have not descended and are located in the pelvis, abdomen, or groin. This may be referred to as type 1, whereas less severe cases might be called type 2. LCH is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in the LHCGR gene.Although there is no specific treatment or cure for LCH, there may be ways to manage the symptoms.

Symptoms typically begin in childhood and are characterized by muscle cramping and stiffening (myopathy) after exercise or other strenuous activity. These symptoms can worsen in cold temperatures and are usually painless, however, some individuals may have mild discomfort. Some cases of Brody myopathy are caused by mutations in the ATP2A1 gene. The cause of Brody myopathy for individuals not found to have an ATP2A1 gene mutation remains unknown. Brody myopathy is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner with a few reported cases of autosomal dominant inheritance. While there is no one treatment for Brody myopathy, certain muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene and blood pressure medications called calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil may be useful. Some researchers suggest that individuals found to have an ATP2A1 gene mutation have a slightly different disorder in which symptoms appear at an earlier age. They use the disease term 'Brody disease' for individuals with an identifiedmutation versus 'Brody syndrome' for those that do not. More research may help clarify whether these are two different disorders or a variation of the same disorder.","name":"Brody myopathy","parents":["Orphanet_209199","Orphanet_206656"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["Brody myopathy"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["sarcoplasmic reticulum -Ca2+ATPase deficiency","Brody disease"]},"ancestors":["OTAR_0000006","EFO_0009676","OTAR_0000018","EFO_0002970","Orphanet_209199","EFO_0004145","Orphanet_71859","Orphanet_206656","Orphanet_206634","Orphanet_207049","EFO_0000618","EFO_0000508","MONDO_0003939","Orphanet_183497"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000006","OTAR_0000018","EFO_0000618"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_53347","name":"Orphanet_53347"}}}

Common features of the condition include feeding difficulties, lethargy, seizures, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), developmental delay, microcephaly (unusually small head size), and megaloblastic anemia. Methylcobalamin deficiency cbl G type is caused by changes (mutations) in the MTR gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency encompasses a spectrum of disease that includes autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms, with severity correlating with the residual enzyme activity. Individuals who are heterozygous for pathogenic variants in GCH1 have symptoms ranging from none (due to reduced penetrance) to dopa-responsive dystonia, which is the most common presentation in symptomatic cases, to rarer neurological presentations such as adult-onset \"benign\" parkinsonism, various types of focal dystonia, and symptoms simulating cerebral palsy or spastic paraplegia. Hyperphenylalaninemia is absent, and patients respond well to treatment with levodopa. Individuals who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for pathogenic variants in GCH1 typically present with hyperphenylalaninemia, often identified by newborn screening, and severe neurological features and due to very low or undetectable enzyme activity. Treatment with levodopa, BH4, and 5-hydroxytryptophan can improve the symptoms but does not prevent development of severe encephalopathy.
