People with GS2 have unusually light skin and silver-colored hair. They are also prone to recurrent infections and develop an immune condition called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). HLH can damage organs and tissues throughout the body, causing life-threatening complications. GS2 is caused by changes (mutations) in the RAB27A gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

It is mainly found in females and is characterized by small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia) and characteristic linear skin markings on the head and neck. The signs and symptoms of this condition may include abnormalities of the brain, heart, and genitourinary system. Other symptoms may include short stature, developmental delay, and finger and toenails that do not grow normally (nail dystrophy). MLS syndrome is typically caused by either a deletion of certain genetic material on the p (short) arm of the X chromosome or by a mutation in the HCCS gene. In some cases, it may be caused by mutations in the COX7B and NDUFB11 genes, (also located on the X chromosome). According to the mutated gene, the disease may be classified in three subtypes. This condition is inherited in an X-linked manner and is thought to result in serious early developmental concerns in males, leading to almost no males with this condition surviving to delivery.Although there is no specific treatment or cure for MLS syndrome, there may be ways to manage the symptoms. A team of doctors is often needed to figure out the treatment options based on each person's symptoms.","name":"Microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome","parents":["Orphanet_183481","Orphanet_98638","Orphanet_117573","MONDO_0019294","Orphanet_202948","MONDO_0024255","Orphanet_139027","Orphanet_98464"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["MCOPS7","syndromic microphthalmia type 7","MIDAS syndrome","Microphthalmia - dermal aplasia - sclerocornea","linear skin defects with multiple congenital anomalies type 1","Syndromic microphthalmia type 7","microphthalmia-dermal aplasia-sclerocornea syndrome","linear skin defects with multiple congenital anomalies","microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome","MLS syndrome"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["linear skin defects with multiple congenital anomalies 1","microphthalmia dermal aplasia and sclerocornea syndrome","Micropthalmia syndromic 7","LSDMCA1"]},"ancestors":["Orphanet_183763","MONDO_0002025","Orphanet_183545","Orphanet_98555","Orphanet_202948","Orphanet_108987","EFO_0005774","MONDO_0000425","Orphanet_98554","Orphanet_139027","MONDO_0024458","Orphanet_117573","MONDO_0024255","EFO_0000677","Orphanet_71859","EFO_0003966","MONDO_0100284","EFO_0000618","Orphanet_183481","EFO_0005569","EFO_0005548","MONDO_0000508","MONDO_0019755","Orphanet_98638","Orphanet_98464","OTAR_0000018","Orphanet_183557","Orphanet_183757","MONDO_0019294","MONDO_0020147","MONDO_0021154","EFO_0009386","MONDO_0020606","EFO_0000701","Orphanet_101435","Orphanet_68346","EFO_0000508","Orphanet_96346","Orphanet_183472","EFO_0010285","Orphanet_183530"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["MONDO_0002025","MONDO_0024458","EFO_0000618","OTAR_0000018","EFO_0010285"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_2556","name":"Orphanet_2556"}}}

The Rh antigens maintain the integrity of the RBC membrane and therefore, RBCs which lack Rh antigens have an abnormal shape. There are two types of Rh deficiency syndrome: The regulator type is associated with many different changes (mutations) in the RHAG gene. The amorph type is caused by inactive copies of a gene (silent alleles) at the RH locus. As a result, the RBCs do not express any of the Rh antigens. The absence of the Rh complex alters the RBC shape, increases its tendency to break down (osmotic fragility), and shortens its lifespan, resulting in a hemolytic anemia that is usually mild. These patients are at risk of having adverse transfusion reactions because they may produce antibodies against several of the Rh antigens and can only receive blood from people who have the same condition. Rh deficiency syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Management is individualized according to the severity of hemolytic anemia.","name":"Rh deficiency syndrome","parents":["Orphanet_98365"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["Rh-null syndrome","Rh deficiency syndrome"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["RH-null, regulator type","Rh-null disease, regulator type","RHNR","Rh-Mod","Rh-null disease","RHN","Rh-null hemolytic Anemia, regulator type"]},"ancestors":["Orphanet_98364","Orphanet_98365","MONDO_0004139","OTAR_0000018","MONDO_0003689","MONDO_0002280","EFO_0000508","Orphanet_182043","EFO_0005803","Orphanet_183651","Orphanet_158300"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000018","EFO_0005803"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_71275","name":"Orphanet_71275"}}}

In general, symptoms of Cockayne syndrome type III are usually not noticeable until later in childhood.","name":"Cockayne syndrome type 3","parents":["Orphanet_191"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["Cockayne syndrome type III","Cockayne syndrome type 3"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["Cockayne syndrome, type III","Cockayne syndrome type C"]},"ancestors":["Orphanet_183422","Orphanet_183500","MONDO_0002025","MONDO_0004884","EFO_0005772","Orphanet_96210","EFO_0005774","Orphanet_139027","MONDO_0024458","MONDO_0024255","EFO_0000677","EFO_0004238","MONDO_0024417","MONDO_0021945","Orphanet_791","Orphanet_191","EFO_1001455","MONDO_0015333","Orphanet_98661","OTAR_0000018","EFO_0000589","Orphanet_101435","EFO_0000701","Orphanet_68367","Orphanet_183490","EFO_0000508","EFO_1000017","Orphanet_183530","Orphanet_140162","Orphanet_183763","MONDO_0021084","Orphanet_139009","EFO_0008624","MONDO_0004580","OTAR_0000020","Orphanet_71859","EFO_0003966","Orphanet_363245","EFO_0000618","Orphanet_98657","EFO_0005548","MONDO_0000429","MONDO_0037940","MONDO_0019755","MONDO_0000508","EFO_0008499","Orphanet_183757","EFO_0009386","Orphanet_90642","Orphanet_68346","Orphanet_71862","EFO_0010285","EFO_0003839"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["MONDO_0002025","MONDO_0024458","OTAR_0000018","OTAR_0000020","EFO_0000618","EFO_0010285"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_90324","name":"Orphanet_90324"}}}

Though there is a wide spectrum of phenotypic variability, broadly, patients with CBL-related disorder have presented with developmental delay, intellectual disability, neurodevelopmental alterations, prenatal lymphatic anomalies, cardiac malformations as well as vascular anomalies particularly affecting the brain (e.g. Moya-moya arteriopathies), craniofacial features indicative of a RASopathy, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, edema of the legs, musculoskeletal and respiratory thorax abnormalities, ectodermal features including cafe-au-lait spots, immunological and hematological disorders and susceptibility to tumors diagnosed as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) that is usually self-remitting. Note tumor risk beyond JMML has not yet been thoroughly assessed. Due to the clinical presentation of a broad spectrum of these and other phenotypes in patients with variants in CBL, these conditions are currently defined by experts in reference to the causal gene, CBL.","name":"Noonan syndrome-like disorder with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia","parents":["Orphanet_98733","Orphanet_183422"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["CBL syndrome","CBL-related disorder","Noonan-like syndrome","Noonan syndrome-like disorder with JMML","Noonan syndrome-like disorder with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia","Cbl syndrome"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["Noonan syndrome-like disorder with or without juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia","NSLL","Cbl mutation-associated syndrome"]},"ancestors":["Orphanet_183422","MONDO_0024573","OTAR_0000006","EFO_0009676","Orphanet_98054","Orphanet_98733","EFO_0000318","EFO_0000538","MONDO_0003939","MONDO_0019755","EFO_0000319","OTAR_0000018","MONDO_0000651","Orphanet_217595","EFO_0002970","OTAR_0000010","MONDO_0000591","EFO_0002945","EFO_0003777","EFO_0000508","EFO_1001502","Orphanet_183570","Orphanet_140162","Orphanet_183530","Orphanet_99739"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000006","EFO_0000319","OTAR_0000018","OTAR_0000010"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_363972","name":"Orphanet_363972"}}}
