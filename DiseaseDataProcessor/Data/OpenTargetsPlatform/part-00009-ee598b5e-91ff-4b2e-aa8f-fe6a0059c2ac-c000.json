Symptoms include episodes of abdominal pain, recurrent inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), abnormal enlargement of the liver and/or spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and the development of skin lesions known as erruptive xanthomas. Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is caused by changes (mutations) in the LPL gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Treatment aims to control symptoms and blood triglyceride levels with a very low-fat diet.

Most affected individuals experience progressive loss of kidney function, usually resulting in end-stage kidney disease. People with Alport syndrome frequently develop sensorineural hearing loss in late childhood or early adolescence. The eye abnormalities seen in this condition seldom lead to vision loss. Alport syndrome can have different patterns of inheritance. About15 percentof Alport syndrome cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are caused bymutations in both copies of the COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes. Treatment is based on the symptoms present and may include medications to delay the progression of kidney disease. In most cases, a kidney transplant is eventually needed.","name":"Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome","parents":["Orphanet_63","EFO_1000017"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["autosomal recessive Alport syndrome","Alport syndrome, autosomal recessive"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["nephropathy and deafness","Alport syndrome autosomal recessive","Alport syndrome recessive type"]},"ancestors":["Orphanet_98056","EFO_0009674","EFO_1002050","Orphanet_98655","Orphanet_96210","Orphanet_183607","EFO_0009690","MONDO_0024458","Orphanet_63","MONDO_0002462","Orphanet_71859","EFO_0003966","EFO_0004238","MONDO_0024417","MONDO_0021945","EFO_0000618","MONDO_0000429","MONDO_0037940","MONDO_0019755","Orphanet_183586","EFO_1002049","EFO_1001455","MONDO_0005129","Orphanet_98640","OTAR_0000018","Orphanet_98643","Orphanet_98641","Orphanet_93550","EFO_0003086","Orphanet_101435","Orphanet_90642","EFO_0004128","EFO_0000508","Orphanet_98646","EFO_1000017"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["EFO_0009690","MONDO_0024458","EFO_0000618","OTAR_0000018"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_88919","name":"Orphanet_88919"}}}

It happens when parts of the spinal cord and nerves come through the open part of the spine. It causes nerve damage and other disabilities. Seventy to ninety percent of children with this condition also have too much fluid on their brains (hydrocephalus). This happens because fluid that protects the brain and spinal cord is unable to drain like it should. The fluid builds up, causing pressure and swelling. Without treatment, a persons head grows too big, and theymay have brain damage. Other disorders of the spinal cord may be seen, including syringomyelia and hip dislocation. The cause of myelomeningocele is unknown.

This condition usually presents with itching (especially on the lower legs) and visible changes of skin hyperpigmentation and thickening that may be exacerbated by chronic scratching and rubbing. Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis is often divided into macular and lichen subtypes although many affected individuals often show both variants coexisting. Lichen amyloidosis characteristically presents as a pruritic eruption of grouped hyperkeratotic papules with a predilection for the shins, calves, ankles and dorsa of feet and thighs. Papules may coalesce to form hyperkeratotic plaques that can resemble lichen planus, lichen simplex or nodular prurigo. Macular amyloidosis is characterized by small pigmented macules that may merge to produce macular hyperpigmentation, sometimes with a reticulate or rippled pattern. In macular and lichen amyloidosis, amyloid is deposited in the papillary dermis in association with grouped colloid bodies, thought to represent degenerate basal keratinocytes. The amyloid deposits probably reflect a combination of degenerate keratin filaments, serum amyloid P component, and deposition of immunoglobulins. PLCA3 inheritance is autosomal recessive.\n\nAmyloidosis cutis dyschromia is a rare primary cutaneous amyloidosis characterized by macular or reticulate hyperpigmentation with symmetrically distributed guttate hypo- and hyperpigmented lesions which progress gradually over the years to involve almost the entire body (with relative sparing of the face, hands, feet and neck). Patients are usually asymptomatic, however mild pruritus may be associated. Amyloid deposition in the papillary dermis is observed on skin biopsy. Systemic amyloidosis is not present and association with generalized morphea, atypical Parkinsonism, spasticity, motor weakness or colon carcinoma is rare.

At birth, the hands and feet may appear abnormally short and broad. Over time, the apparent disproportion becomes even more obvious, especially during the first years of life. Additional features may include: limited extension of the elbows and arms; progressive abnormal curvature of the spine; an enlarged head; and a slightly flattened midface.

Although SIgMD was first described in two children, the disorder can occur in babies, children, and adults. It is characterized by isolated absence or deficiency of immunoglobulin M (IgM), normal levels of other immunoglobulins, and recurrent infections (especially by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenza). The cause is still unclear. The diagnosis includes isolated deficiency ofIgM in the blood and no other immunodeficiency or secondary cause of low IgM. Patients with SIgMD and recurrent infections are managed like other antibody defects and deficiencies.

People with this condition are missing a small piece (deletion) of chromosome 16 at a location designated p13.3. Although once thought to be a severe form of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, it is now emerging as a unique syndrome. Signs and symptoms may include failure to thrive, hypotonia (reduced muscle tone), short stature, microcephaly (unusually small head), characteristic facial features, mild to moderate intellectual disability, organ anomalies (i.e. heart and/or kidney problems), and vulnerability to infections. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide information about whether the deletion was inherited. In most cases, parents do not have any chromosome abnormalities. However, sometimes one parent has a balanced translocation where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having a child with a chromosome abnormality like a deletion. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.To learn more about chromosome abnormalities in general, view our GARD fact sheet on Chromosome Disorders.","name":"Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to 16p13.3 microdeletion","parents":["MONDO_0022752"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to 16p13.3 microdeletion"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["Rsts deletion syndrome","Rubinstein-Taybi deletion syndrome","16p13.3 deletion syndrome","chromosome 16p13.3 deletion syndrome, proximal"]},"ancestors":["Orphanet_183422","MONDO_0002025","OTAR_0000006","MONDO_0000761","EFO_0005774","MONDO_0022752","EFO_0009690","EFO_0002461","MONDO_0024458","EFO_0000677","Orphanet_93547","Orphanet_68335","MONDO_0024417","MONDO_0003916","Orphanet_404577","Orphanet_98638","Orphanet_183533","OTAR_0000018","Orphanet_98142","Orphanet_183536","Orphanet_98666","MONDO_0019054","Orphanet_98664","Orphanet_183539","Orphanet_240371","EFO_0000589","Orphanet_101435","Orphanet_156619","Orphanet_783","Orphanet_68367","EFO_0000508","Orphanet_183570","Orphanet_77828","Orphanet_183573","Orphanet_102283","MONDO_0018234","Orphanet_140162","Orphanet_183530","MONDO_0100172","Orphanet_404584","Orphanet_98056","Orphanet_183763","EFO_0004260","MONDO_0021084","EFO_0009676","Orphanet_183524","MONDO_0019042","Orphanet_98655","Orphanet_108987","EFO_0008624","MONDO_0004580","OTAR_0000020","Orphanet_183607","MONDO_0021004","Orphanet_156622","EFO_0001073","Orphanet_71859","EFO_0003966","EFO_0001069","MONDO_0000426","EFO_0000618","Orphanet_98657","EFO_0005548","MONDO_0000429","MONDO_0019755","MONDO_0000508","Orphanet_261826","EFO_0009663","Orphanet_404571","Orphanet_183557","Orphanet_165707","EFO_0005541","Orphanet_183757","Orphanet_98127","Orphanet_69028","EFO_0003086","EFO_0009386","MONDO_0016756","EFO_0001379","Orphanet_156638","Orphanet_71862","Orphanet_404568","Orphanet_102020","EFO_0003839","Orphanet_261956"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["MONDO_0002025","OTAR_0000006","EFO_0009690","MONDO_0024458","OTAR_0000018","OTAR_0000020","EFO_0000618","EFO_0001379"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_353281","name":"Orphanet_353281"}}}
