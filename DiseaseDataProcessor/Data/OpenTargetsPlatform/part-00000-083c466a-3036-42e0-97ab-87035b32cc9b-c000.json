It often begins slowly and usually reaches a plateau over a few months or years. The cause of cervical dystonia is often unknown. In some cases there is a family history. Several genes have been associated with cervical dystonia, including GNAL, THAP1, CIZ1, and ANO3. Other cases may be linked to an underlying disease (e.g. Parkinson disease), neck trauma, or certain medications.

Almost all individuals with types I, II, and III have similar signs and symptoms. A fourth subtype has additionally been proposed for individuals that have less severe symptoms.

The symptoms described in the few cases reported in the medical literature suggest that there may be variation in the severity of the symptoms ranging from severe early-onset cases, to milder late-onset presentations. In severe cases symptoms may include persistent and very low levels of blood's sugar in newborns (neonatal hypoglycemia), failure to thrive, build-up of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis), liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) and liver failure leading to neurological degeneration. Milder cases present during childhood with fewer and less serious liver problems. Infections and fasting may trigger the symptoms. PEPCK1 deficiency inheritance is autosomal recessive. It is caused by mutations in the PEPCK1 gene. Some researchers believe that the severity of the disease depend upon the mutations resulting in less or more PEPCK1 activity (the more active the enzyme is, the less severe the disease is, and vice versa). Treatment depend on the symptoms and may include giving extra carbohydrates during heavy exercise and illness or other times of fasting (formal sick day regimen) by the dietitian.PEPCK1 is the cytosolic form of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) enzyme, the other being the mitochondrial (PEPCK2).","name":"phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase deficiency, cytosolic","obsoleteTerms":["Orphanet_79316"],"parents":["MONDO_0017320"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase deficiency, cytosolic"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase deficiency","PEPCK1 deficiency","PEPCK deficiency, cytosolic","phosphopyruvate carboxylase deficiency","PCK1 deficiency, cytosolic","phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase deficiency","PEP carboxykinase deficiency","phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-1 (PCK1) deficiency","PCKDC","PEPCK 1 deficiency"]},"ancestors":["EFO_0000589","MONDO_0037792","OTAR_0000018","MONDO_0019052","EFO_0009406","OTAR_0000020","EFO_0000508","MONDO_0017320","MONDO_0019225","MONDO_0019214"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000018","OTAR_0000020"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0009866","name":"MONDO_0009866"}}}

Pseudodiastrophic dysplasia differs from diastrophic dysplasia on the basis of clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic findings. Clubfoot can be treated by surgical therapy, and neonatal contractures and scoliosis can be relieved by physical therapy. Several of the reported patients died in the neonatal period or during infancy.","name":"pseudodiastrophic dysplasia","parents":["MONDO_0019755"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["pseudodiastrophic dysplasia"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["Pseudodiastrophic dwarfism"]},"ancestors":["OTAR_0000018","MONDO_0019755"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000018"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0009914","name":"MONDO_0009914"}}}

Methionine may also be increased in urine. However, because elevated levels of methionine in the blood itself is a risk factor for development of neurological signs and symptoms, people with GNMT deficiency can have neurological problems when methionine levelsare greater than 800μmol/L.

Symptoms include episodes of abdominal pain, recurrent inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), abnormal enlargement of the liver and/or spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and the development of skin lesions known as erruptive xanthomas. Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is caused by changes (mutations) in the LPL gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
