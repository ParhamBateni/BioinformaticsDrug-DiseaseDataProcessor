*ClinVar: Some of diseases are not related to any genes.
Should we exclude these diseases? Should I use gene_condition
file only?
**We use all the disease data in the database as long as we know
this database supports data about disease targets some where
in its datasets

*COSMIC: Related genes are hard to get from cancer name
Many samples each pointing to thousands of mutations related to the cancer
** As long as we know that this database has data about disease
targets it is good to use it

*CTDBase: This database diseases are extracted into a file
Can I use these diseases?
**We use all the disease data in the database as long as we know
this database supports data about disease targets some where
in its datasets

*DOID: It just have IDs
It can only be used for ID mapping
**Ask from Ali

*DisGeNET: I just have the disease mappings
**We use all the disease data in the database as long as we know
this database supports data about disease targets some where
in its datasets

*EFO: Same as DOID
**Ask from Ali

*HP: Same as DOID,EFO
**Ask from Ali

*OMIM: Some diseases are not marked with a gene loci
**Exclude diseases with not a gene loci specified for them

*DrugRepurposingHub: Is it ok to just get the disease data
and just make sure that the database supports target info?
**We use all the disease data in the database as long as we know
this database supports data about disease targets some where
in its datasets

Pharos: Could be used for Drugs

*SIDER: has side effect of a disease data not gene data


OMIM: I don't have access to full data

mention about humans only

indications section: failures are important data for example TTD drugs
databases mapping disease to drugs

pdf or svg
suggest: 



TTD: it has drug to disease mapping should i use it?
should i consider the approval state?
